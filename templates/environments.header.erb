# This is the Juju config file, which you can use to specify multiple
# environments in which to deploy. By default Juju ships with AWS
# (default), HP Cloud, OpenStack, Azure, MaaS, Local and Manual
# providers. See https://juju.ubuntu.com/docs for more information

# An environment configuration must always specify at least the
# following information:
# - name (to identify the environment)
# - type (to specify the provider)
# In the following example the name is "myenv" and type is "ec2".
# myenv:
#    type: ec2

# Values in <brackets> below need to be filled in by the user.
# Optional attributes are shown commented out, with
# a sample value or a value in <brackets>.

# There are several settings supported by all environments, all of which
# are optional and have specified default values. For more info, see the
# Juju documentation.

# The default environment is chosen when an environment is not
# specified using any of the following, in descending order of precedence:
#  1. -e or --environment command line parameter, passed after the command, e.g.
#     $ juju add-unit -e myenv myservice
#  2. By setting JUJU_ENV environment variable.
#  3. Using the juju switch command like this:
#     $ juju switch myenv
#

# You can control how Juju harvests machines by using the
# provisioner-harvest-mode setting. Harvesting is a process wherein
# Juju attempts to reclaim unused machines.
#
# Options are:
#
# Don't harvest any machines.
# provisioner-harvest-mode: none
#
# Only harvest machines that Juju knows about and are dead.
# provisioner-harvest-mode: destroyed
#
# Only harvest machines that Juju doesn't know about.
# provisioner-harvest-mode: unknown
#
# Harvest both dead and unknown machines.
# provisioner-harvest-mode: all
