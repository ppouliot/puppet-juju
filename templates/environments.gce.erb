      # Google Auth Info
      # The GCE provider uses OAuth to authenticate. This requires that
      # you set it up and get the relevant credentials. For more information
      # see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/api/how-tos/authorization.
      # The key information can be downloaded as a JSON file, or copied, from:
      #   https://console.developers.google.com/project/<projet>/apiui/credential
      # Either set the path to the downloaded JSON file here:
      auth-file:

      # ...or set the individual fields for the credentials. Either way, all
      # three of these are required and have specific meaning to GCE.

      # Google instance info
      # To provision instances and perform related operations, the provider
      # will need to know which GCE project to use and into which region to
      # provision. While the region has a default, the project ID is
      # required. For information on the project ID, see
      # https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/projects and regarding regions
      # see https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/zones.

      # The GCE provider uses pre-built images when provisioning instances.
      # You can customize the location in which to find them with the
      # image-endpoint setting. The default value is the a location within
      # GCE, so it will give you the best speed when bootstrapping or adding
      # machines. For more information on the image cache see
      # https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/.
